Here we compared the original jup notebook from dimred paper, 
and also with yeni. jup notebook we generated similar results using eigenvectors as inputs 
which was calculated by plink. 
They produced similar results this means that we could either start with vcf files, eigenvectors by plink, or cov matrices by beagle (?)
